# Breast Cancer Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from Scikit-Learn. The dataset consists of **569 samples** with **30 features**, used for binary classification of tumors into **malignant (cancerous)** and **benign (non-cancerous)**.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** Scikit-Learn (`load_breast_cancer`)
- **Features:** 30 numerical attributes extracted from digitized tumor images
- **Classes:**
  - 0 → Malignant (Cancerous)
  - 1 → Benign (Non-Cancerous)

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Using `load_breast_cancer` from Scikit-Learn.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Checking missing values, summary statistics, and feature distributions.
   - Visualizing correlations between features.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature scaling and normalization.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.
   - Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Results Interpretation**:
   - Visualizing confusion matrix and ROC curves.
   - Analyzing feature importance.

## Results
- Model evaluation metrics and performance comparison.
- Feature importance and insights from the dataset.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Collab
